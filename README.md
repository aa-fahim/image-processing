## Image processing filters using OpenCV

This project demonstrates knowledge of Python programming and image processing principles. Libraries that were frequently used include NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

The image filters are Python scripts that take an input image and occasionally extra parameters to transform the image similar to apps such as Snapchat and Instagram. The project includes over 50 image filters including enhancement, restoration, hue/saturation alteration and greyscale filters. The two most visually appeasing are the oilify and cartoonify filters.

The oilify filter takes an input image and outputs an oil painting version of itself.

The code for the oilify filter can be seen [here](https://github.com/aa-fahim/Image-Processing/tree/master/Oilify%20Filter).

The cartoonify filter takes an input image and outputs a cartoon drawing version of itself.
